                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h3>

                <p>
                  Cookies are text files containing small amounts of
                  information, which are downloaded to your browsing device
                  (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website.
                  Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them
                  —or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps
                  websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.
                </p>

                <h3>WHAT ARE COOKIES USED FOR?</h3>

                <h3>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?</h3>

                <p>
                  The type of cookies used on most websites can generally be put
                  into one of six categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance,
                  Functionality, Flash, Tailored Content and Targeting. In order
                  to provide you with the best browsing experience, Black and
                  Belonging uses all of these categories on the Site. You can
                  find out more about each cookie category in the sections
                  below.
                </p>

                <h4>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h4>

                <p>
                  These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around
                  the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas.
                  Without these cookies, some of our services can’t be provided.
                </p>

                <h4>Performance Cookies:</h4>

                <p>
                  These cookies collect information about how you use the Site
                  (e.g., which pages you go to most often, or if you get error
                  messages from certain pages). These cookies don’t gather
                  information that identifies you. All information these cookies
                  collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the Site
                  works.
                </p>

                <h4>Functionality Cookies:</h4>

                <p>
                  These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make
                  (such as your user name, language or the region you’re in).
                  These cookies can also be used to remember changes you’ve made
                  to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can
                  customize. The information these cookies collect may be
                  anonymous and they cannot track your browsing activity on
                  other websites.
                </p>

                <h4>Flash Cookies:</h4>
                <p>
                  We may, in certain circumstances, use Adobe Flash Player to
                  deliver special content, such as video clips or animation. To
                  improve your user experience, Local Shared Objects (commonly
                  known as “Flash cookies”) are employed to provide functions
                  such as remembering your settings and preferences. Flash
                  cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed
                  through an interface different from the one provided by your
                  web browser. This means it is not possible to manage Flash
                  cookies through your browser in the same way you would
                  normally manage cookies. Instead, you can access your Flash
                  management tools from Adobe’s website at
                  http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.{" "}
                </p>

                <h4>Tailored Content Cookies:</h4>

                <p>
                  Tailored content cookies help the Site provide enhanced
                  features and display content in a way that is relevant to you.
                  These cookies help the Site determine what information to show
                  you based on how you have used the Site previously. These
                  cookies do not track your browsing activity on other websites.
                </p>

                <h4>Targeting Cookies:</h4>
                <p>
                  These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more
                  relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to
                  limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as
                  help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.{" "}
                </p>

                <br />
                <h3>HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?</h3>

                <p>
                  The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device
                  depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie.
                  Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop
                  browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device
                  until they expire or are deleted.
                </p>

                <h3>FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</h3>

                <p>
                  First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third
                  party cookies are cookies that another party places on your
                  browsing device through our Site. For example, third party
                  websites will place a cookie on your browsing device if you
                  click on such third-party website link when browsing the Site.
                </p>

                <h3>HOW TO CONTROL AND DELETE COOKIES THROUGH YOUR BROWSER?</h3>
